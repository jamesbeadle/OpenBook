    <p>The Debtors View in OpenBook is a crucial tool for financial management, specifically designed to
        provide a clear and comprehensive summary of the amounts owed by customers. Here's a detailed
        overview of its features:
        Debtor Days and Outstanding Totals: This view prominently displays debtor days columns, which help
        in understanding how long invoices have been outstanding. Additionally, it shows the total amount
        owed by each customer, providing a quick snapshot of pending receivables.
        
        Advanced Filtering Options: Users can filter the data based on various parameters such as the total
        amount outstanding, custom date ranges, and standard accounting periods like the last 30, 60 days,
        etc. These filters make it easy to sort and analyse debtor information according to specific needs.
        Actionable Options on Debtor Rows: Each row representing a debtor in the view comes with options to
        perform customer-specific actions. This could include viewing detailed account information, updating
        customer details, or initiating direct communication.
        Bulk Actions for Efficiency: A significant feature of the Debtors View is the ability to select multiple
        debtor rows for bulk actions. Users can send reminder notifications, apply discounts, or perform other
        bulk operations, greatly enhancing efficiency and saving time, especially for businesses with a large
        number of debtors.
        The Debtors View in OpenBook is an integral part of the accounts receivables process, providing
        businesses with the necessary features to manage, analyse, and take action on outstanding customer
        debts effectively.</p>

            The Customer Setup View in OpenBook is a dynamic interface designed to manage customer
information effectively:
Essential Customer Information: It includes all the standard details you would expect, such as main
contact information, tax ID, payment terms, and the assigned account manager. This ensures that all
critical customer information is easily accessible and well-organised.
Multiple Address and Contact Cards: Organisations have the ability to list multiple addresses and
contacts for each customer. This is particularly useful for managing customers with various locations or
numerous points of contact, providing a more comprehensive understanding of each customer's
profile.
Customer Status and Types: The view includes fields for categorising customers by status and type.
These classifications are not just labels; they play a crucial role in the app's more advanced reporting
features, allowing for more nuanced analysis and segmentation of the customer base.
The Customer Setup View in OpenBook is a powerful tool for managing customer relationships,
providing businesses with necessary information and features to understand and cater to their
customers effectively.
