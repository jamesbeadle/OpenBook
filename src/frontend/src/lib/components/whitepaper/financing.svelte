    <p>The Financing View in OpenBook, is a key feature that significantly enhances the value of the minimum
        viable product for its users. This view offers a unique and powerful capability:
        Customisable Finance Agreements: Users can create their own finance agreements by specifying
        terms such as the repayment period and interest rate. This flexibility allows for tailored financial
        solutions that align with the specific needs and circumstances of each user.
        Investment Participation Based on Real-Time Data: The platform facilitates investment opportunities
        by allowing potential investors to participate in these finance agreements. What sets OpenBook apart is
        the use of real-time, fully on-chain financial data from user organisations.
        Granular Detail with Data Protection: While providing comprehensive financial data to potential
        investors, OpenBook maintains a high standard of data protection. The system reveals enough
        information for investors to make informed decisions but does so without compromising the sensitivity
        of the underlying financial data, a separation of concerns key to OpenBookâ€™s architecture. This balance
        ensures that while investors have access to necessary data, the privacy and security of financial
        information are not jeopardised.
        This Financing View is not just another feature; it's a cornerstone of OpenBook's value proposition,
        providing an innovative approach to financial management and investment in a secure,
        blockchain-based environment.</p>
