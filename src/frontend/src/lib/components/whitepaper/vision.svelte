    Businesses are increasingly turning to Software as a Service (SaaS)
    platforms to manager their internal processes. Platforms like Salesforce &
    QuickBooks use the common software distribution model in which applications
    are hosted by a third-party provider and made available to customers over
    the internet. This model allows businesses to access software applications
    without the need for internal hardware or technical expertise, paying on a
    subscription basis.

  <p>
    Businesses today face the task of managing multiple subscriptions across a
    range of platforms. Their use cases often extend further, encompassing
    multiple organisations, currencies, and user roles. These challenges open
    the door for opportunities to create a more streamlined and integrated
    approach to business operations.

  <p>
    In the world of SaaS platforms, diversity in functionality often comes at a
    cost. These platforms can be cluttered with ads, compromising the
    user experience. Additionally, they are characterised by complex
    subscription models, where access to full features is often gated behind
    various tiers of service. This can lead to a situation where businesses feel
    trapped, using software that doesn't fully meet their needs or forces them
    into paying more for essential features.

    Data is also privately held by centralised web service entities, 
    with data access potentially restricted without notice. 
    Changing this paradigm is essential. By shifting towards a model where businesses retain ownership of their data, 
    they are empowered to explore and implement custom solutions tailored to their unique needs and objectives.

    The Internet Computer Protocol has provided the world with a foundation
    for genuine decentralisation. This leap in technology allows us to transform how we as business interact with the 
    Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms we are increasingly reliant on.
