<h1 class="text-2xl">Value Proposition</h1>
<div class="flex flex-col space-y-4 mt-4">
    <p>$BOOK Utility Token
        OpenBook operates as a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation). The $BOOK token is used
        within the DAO for the following purposes:
        - Organisations will pay an annual subscription for the basic OpenBook service with $BOOK
        tokens.
        - Organisations will be able to settle invoices and pay employees in $BOOK, along with any other
        ICRC token.
        - Neuron holders will be rewarded with $BOOK maturity interest.
        Future features will enable the $BOOK utility token to be used for:
        - Finance professionals will be able to design and build financial reports based on the granular
        chart of accounts structure an organisation sets up. These professionals will be rewarded in
        $BOOK tokens when an organisation uses their designed report.
        - As OpenBook grows it will venture into all areas of business management, subscriptions to these
        additional advanced features will also be paid using $BOOK.
        Genesis Token Allocation
        We will decentralise OpenBook through the following token allocation at genesis:
        - James Beadle + Team - 12%
        - Funded NFT Holders - 12%
        - SNS Decentralisation Sale - 25%
        - DAO Treasury - 51%
        DAO Reward Structure
        The OpenBook DAO's rewards are funded by the minting of new BOOK tokens, minting 2.5% of the total
        supply annually.
        The minted $BOOK is distributed throughout the year for the following reward categories
        - Professional Service Rewards (75%)
        - Governance Rewards (25%)
        Professional Service Rewards
        In the first instance professional service rewards will be utilised for the writing of jurisdictional specific
        reports by local finance professionals. These professionals will build tailored reports for their local
        jurisdictional finance rules and formats that users in their locality can utilise.
        
        This reward pool will be expanded to other experts in fields relevant to future OpenBook features.
        Governance Rewards
        Initially the DAO will operate using the non-custom SNS governance proposals. Failed proposals will cost
        10 $BOOK tokens to a neuron holder which will be deposited into the DAO’s treasury.
        
        Revenue
        OpenBook's revenue model is thoughtfully designed to sustain and grow the DAO while ensuring
        practical utility and value for its users.
        Diversified Revenue Model
        To avoid creating a supply shock by pegging services to a fixed token amount, OpenBook's revenue
        streams are diversified. This approach mitigates the risk of reduced service usage due to infeasibility,
        ensuring long-term stability and utility.
        Each OpenBook service will generate revenue through an annual subscription model. The core
        subscription will be charged in $ICP to establish a stable revenue base. Additional features will be
        payable using the BOOK token enabling a balanced mix of $BOOK and $ICP revenue.
        Revenue Redistribution Plan
        In line with our commitment to directly benefit neuron holders, OpenBook will allocate 50% of any ICRC-1
        token received by the DAO each month to neuron holders.
        Distribution to neuron holders will be proportional to each neuron's total $BOOK value and its remaining
        duration. This ensures a fair and equitable redistribution of revenue.
        Calculation for this distribution will be based on the status of BOOK neurons as at the end of each
        month, aligning with the DAO's transparent and community-focused ethos.
        Overall Revenue Philosophy
        OpenBook’s revenue philosophy is rooted in creating a sustainable ecosystem where the utility token
        maintains its value and relevance.
        The reinvestment of revenues into the DAO and direct distribution to neuron holders are designed to
        foster a cycle of growth, user engagement, and shared prosperity.
        
        DAO Valuation
        In forecasting the potential revenue for our platform, we conducted a comparative analysis between
        two established SaaS platforms: Salesforce and QuickBooks.
        QuickBooks: Highly popular in the accounting software market. As of the recent data, QuickBooks
        generated a total revenue of $9.6 billion, a 25% increase year-over-year. Their combined platform
        revenue, which includes QuickBooks Online, TurboTax Online, and Credit Karma, accounted for $6.6
        billion, marking a 39% growth.
        Salesforce: A dominant force in the CRM space. Salesforce has seen consistent growth over the years. In
        2023, their annual revenue was $31.352 billion, up 18.35% from 2022. To provide a broader perspective,
        their revenue in 2022 was $26.492 billion, marking a 24.66% growth from 2021, which had a revenue of
        $21.252 billion, a 24.3% increase from 2020.
        Both these platforms represent a combined user base of approximately 6.6 million. It's crucial to
        understand that the impressive revenue figures, especially from Salesforce, often stem from their
        enterprise licensing agreements. Enterprise licences differ significantly from individual or small business
        licences. They're priced higher, offer an extensive range of features, and often include additional
        services like consulting, training, and customisation. This model can significantly inflate the average
        revenue per user, especially for platforms like Salesforce, which caters to large corporations and
        businesses across the globe.
        Drawing insights from QuickBooks and Salesforce, we find that Salesforce's revenue is approximately
        $10,451 per user per year, while QuickBooks stands at about $2,667 per user. We'll use the more
        conservative figure from QuickBooks as our benchmark.
        To hit a valuation of $1 billion over 8 years, with a projected revenue per user of $2,667, we would require
        a user base of 37,500. This goal entails an average onboarding of roughly 4,688 users per annum with
        this target representing a mere 0.57% of the combined 6.6 million user base of Salesforce and
        QuickBooks.
