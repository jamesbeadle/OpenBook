    <h1 class="text-2xl">The OpenBook DAO</h1>
    
    <p>
        We aim to decentralise OpenBook using the Internet Computer Protocol's SNS DAO infrastructure. 
        Decentralising the platform will ensure that all future profits are in the hands of the DAO. 
        The platform will operate using our utility token, $BOOK.
    </p>

    <p>
        The DAO allows purchase of an organisation and the recharging of a services using $BOOK and $ICP tokens. 
        The DAO will burn the $BOOK tokens and use the $ICP to purchase and burn $BOOK from exchanges until the total supply is back to 100m.
    </p>

    <p>
        The DAO will reward users for participation in governance with $BOOK tokens. 
        Failed proposals will cost 10 $BOOK tokens to a neuron holder which will be deposited into the DAOâ€™s treasury.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will decentralise OpenBook through the following token allocation at genesis:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc px-4">
        <li>Waterway Labs - 12%</li>
        <li>Presale - 12%</li>
        <li>SNS Decentralisation Sale - 25%</li>
        <li>DAO Treasury - 51%</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Revenue</p>
    <p>We compared two established platforms (Salesforce & QuickBook) to forecast potential revenue for OpenBook.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Salesforce:</b> 
        Salesforce is the market leading sales SaaS platform that has seen consistent growth over the years. 
        Their annual revenue increased by 24.3%, 24.66% and 24.3% in the 3 years from 2021 to 2023.
        Salesforce had a turnover of $31.352 billion in the year ending 2023.</p>
    <p>
        <b>QuickBooks:</b> 
        QuickBooks is a popular accountancy SaaS product. 
        Their parent company Intuit had revenue of $15.81B in the twelve months ending April 30, 2024, with 12.39% growth year-over-year. 
    </p>

    <p>These impressive revenue figures, especially in Salesforce's case, stem from complex pricing models. 
        Central to OpenBook's revenue strategy is our 'Pay as You Use' pricing model. 
        You organisation comes charged up 100%, as it run downs we will keep track of your usage. OpenBook will then suggest a topup amount for your organisation in $BOOK or $ICP.
