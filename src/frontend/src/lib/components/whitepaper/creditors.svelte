    <p>The Debtors View in OpenBook is a crucial tool for financial management, specifically designed to
        provide a clear and comprehensive summary of the amounts owed by customers. Here's a detailed
        overview of its features:
        Debtor Days and Outstanding Totals: This view prominently displays debtor days columns, which help
        in understanding how long invoices have been outstanding. Additionally, it shows the total amount
        owed by each customer, providing a quick snapshot of pending receivables.
        
        Advanced Filtering Options: Users can filter the data based on various parameters such as the total
        amount outstanding, custom date ranges, and standard accounting periods like the last 30, 60 days,
        etc. These filters make it easy to sort and analyse debtor information according to specific needs.
        Actionable Options on Debtor Rows: Each row representing a debtor in the view comes with options to
        perform customer-specific actions. This could include viewing detailed account information, updating
        customer details, or initiating direct communication.
        Bulk Actions for Efficiency: A significant feature of the Debtors View is the ability to select multiple
        debtor rows for bulk actions. Users can send reminder notifications, apply discounts, or perform other
        bulk operations, greatly enhancing efficiency and saving time, especially for businesses with a large
        number of debtors.
        The Debtors View in OpenBook is an integral part of the accounts receivables process, providing
        businesses with the necessary features to manage, analyse, and take action on outstanding customer
        debts effectively.</p>

            The Supplier Setup View in OpenBook is similar to the Customer Setup View but includes the option to
            add both on-chain and off-chain payment details for suppliers. Here's a breakdown of its features:
            Standard Supplier Information: This view encompasses all the typical information you would expect in
            a supplier management system, such as contact details, tax IDs, account managers, and more.
            Direct Payments for ICRC Tokens: For suppliers dealing with ICRC tokens, OpenBook allows direct
            payments to be made from the platform itself. This feature streamlines the payment process, making it
            more efficient and secure by leveraging blockchain technology.
            On-Chain and Off-Chain Payment Details: The Supplier Setup View gives organisations the ability to
            add payment details for both on-chain and off-chain transactions. This feature is particularly relevant
            for businesses that operate with a mix of traditional financial systems and blockchain technology. With
            the comprehensive payment details entered, users can easily prepare payment reports.
            Efficient Supplier Management: Similar to the customer setup, this view enables users to manage
            multiple addresses and contacts for each supplier, enhancing the depth of supplier information and
            making it easier to handle complex supplier relationships.
            Overall, the Supplier Setup View in OpenBook is a vital component for businesses looking to manage
            their supplier relationships effectively, especially those that require a blend of traditional and
            blockchain-based payment systems.
