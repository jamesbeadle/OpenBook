        6 canisters are created when you setup an OpenBook organisation. 
        The main canister created is the organisation canister, this canister maanges references to the 5 initial service canisters, 
        containing data and functions to manage your projects, sales, accounts, jobs and timesheets.

        A user is presented with the total charge of their organisation, with all canisters sharing cycles where required. 
        The system prediodically records the cycle usage for an organisation, adjusting the suggested topup amounts to get you back to 100%.
        A user can topup to any % they want.  
        This pricing model allows users to keep the management of their service as simple as possible.
